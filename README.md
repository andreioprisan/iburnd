A social fitness and nutrition platform, powering iburnd.com

iburnd: what is it?
• Description
Get rewarded for working out and staying in shape with your friends!
Social fitness & nutrition, redefined.
• Mission
We aim to make working out and staying in shape more fun by engaging your social circle and getting rewarded! We created and continue to curate the largest nutritional database on the web and an expanding set of workouts that our members can share with friends and stay motivated through social interactions.
Our customized approach to fitness involves members sharing workout and nutritional information on social mediums and get points, badges, and rewards for staying in shape!

What we’re disrupting
•$120+ billion fitness and personal health care market
•We created the largest nutritional database on the web, constantly growing (+5 million foods)
•Creating a unique, high-stickiness social experience that rewards users for sharing with their friends the foods and exercises that they add

Why we’re different
•We get that it is extremely hard to motivate users to enter their workouts and food consumption data day after day. We're not only making this a social experience that rewards users for sharing with their friends the foods and exercises that they partake in, but we're also giving members instant gratification and rewards that will make this platform unique and stand out. We're committed to building a community, not just a product, with an accurate and vast nutritional dataset that is larger than those of the competitors, and that improves over time.
• We will provide nutrition and health tips based on the diet and physical conditioning desired by our members. You simply cannot have a fitness- centered web site like fitocracy.com that does not take into account the nutritional part of being healthy and maximizing one's exercise results without nutritional goals.
• We're creating a social game platform for nutrition and fitness that combines the two for a better overall personal fitness and health care perspective. Instant gratification is received via badges, points and rewards from retailers. We've also built the largest nutritional database on the web and are expanding it continuously via search robots - we have over 5 million foods with full nutritional profiles, while the largest current nutritional database from our competitors are around the 1.5 million foods mark.
• We're working with health insurance providers to figure out how we can provide this data to the insurance companies in exchange for health policy discounts for participating members. This can help reduce health care costs by giving doctors up-to-date information on their patients and instant warnings about preventable conditions such as high cholesterol and sodium that can be detrimental to overall health and physical condition.
